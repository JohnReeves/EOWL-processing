horsley towers east horsley surrey england my dear mrs lovelace i was unsure how to address you so i hope that this letter finds you and finds you well i am writing because i do not know who else to turn to and i figure that you might be able to help i am sorry for the trouble i may have caused by cyphering this letter but i was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand not knowing nothing about me it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read if not and i am wrong about your interests in codes and cyphers then perhaps it wont matter whether you read it or not i am a detective in the small town of erin new york and in a recent investigation i came upon a strangeness that i cannot unpick i was asked to investigate a break in at a local warehouse the hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced alerting the owner but nothing seemed to be missing and the shipping crates remained sealed behind them i found a bullet carryng an unusual inscription and have included a sketch it is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way and the letters make no sense to me i am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them with luck that might shed some light on my investigation given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for england there may also be reason for you to be worried but i most sincerely hope not if you have read this far then please understand how much i appreciate your assistance i look forward with some eagerness to your reply with my gratitude miss kate warne
