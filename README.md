### introA key: Caesar cipher, shifted two left

ADA LOVELACE AND CHARLES BABBAGE ARE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THEY FEATURED IN THE FIRST NATIONAL CIPHER CHALLENGE, AND AGAIN SOME YEARS LATER WHEN WE EXPLORED THEIR EARLY MEETING. IN THIS ADVENTURE WE ARE RETURNING TO THE END OF HER LIFE, AT LEAST THE PART RECORDED IN THE ARCHIVES AT BOSS HEADQUARTERS. I FOUND THIS STORY BY ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THE ROLE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. MANY OF THEM SERVED IN THE MILITARY AND ARE FAMILIAR WITH CODES AND CIPHERS, AND I WONDERED HOW FAR BACK THAT INTEREST WENT. THAT WAS HOW I STUMBLED ACROSS A NOTE FROM PRINCE ALBERT TO LORD PALMERSTON AND THAT STARTED ME DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE THAT LED US HERE. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID. WE WILL MEET SOME FASCINATING NEW CHARACTERS ON THE WAY, AND THE STORY TAKES A TWIST OR TWO. OF COURSE, I KNOW HOW IT ENDS, YOU DON\'T YET, BUT IF YOU STICK WITH IT YOU WILL, AND, LIKE ME, YOU WILL PROBABLY LEARN SOMETHING ON THE WAY. I HAVE POSTED A SKETCH OF A BULLET THAT WAS SENT TO ADA BACK IN 1851 ON THE CASE FILES PAGE. THAT WAS WHERE THE STORY BEGAN AND WHAT DREW ADA IN. TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE MEANT. IT IS NOT A BAD PLACE TO START.

my dear palmerston, i was reluctant to believe that the mystery of the silver bullet could defeat the brilliant minds in your office, but i have come to the conclusion that the singular miss warne was correct in her assumption that this particular cipher would defeat us. her choice of the countess as her confident and collaborator was inspired. the markings on the bullet were clearly significant, though their meaning escaped me entirely until explained. with that knowledge, the accompanying letter commands our attention with its dark allusions to the end of the empire.

i know that you are tempted to ask the two fearsome ladies to step aside and allow the experts in your department to take on the investigation, but my own experience of my dear wife suggests that, once roused, the tigress is unlikely to abandon its meal, and i fear that we will have to stand aside and allow them to continue on their adventure. it is clear that they have the skills and determination to see this through, and i think we will only obstruct them if we interfere.

i trust that you have reached the same conclusion and that i can ask babbage to convey our thanks and best wishes to them both, in the hope that they can bring a speedy resolution to this troubling matter.

MR CHARLES BABBAGE DORSET STREET MARYLEBONE LONDON MY DEAR CHARLES, I HOPE THIS LETTER FINDS YOU WELL AND THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN TO CONSIGN THE INFERNAL RACKET OF STREET URCHINS AND THEIR MUSIC TO THE OUTER REACHES OF THE CITY HAS BORNE SOME FRUIT. I AM WRITING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A CURIOUS LETTER THAT I RECEIVED THIS MORNING FROM A WOMAN IN AMERICA. I TOOK NOTE AS SHE HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO ENCRYPT ITS CONTENTS AND HAD INCLUDED A PUZZLE CONSISTING OF A SHORT SEQUENCE OF LETTERS ENGRAVED ON A BULLET. THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS BULLET APPEARED ARE NOT FULLY EXPLAINED, BUT HER REQUEST IS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENGRAVING AND ATTEMPT TO DECIPHER ITS MEANING. I SAY WE AND OUR, BUT I MUST ADMIT THAT THE REQUEST WAS DIRECTED TO ME ALONE, POSSIBLY BECAUSE, AS A WOMAN, I MIGHT PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MISS WARNE’S LETTER. IT IS APPARENT FROM THE SCRAWL ON THE PAGE THAT SHE IS NOT HIGHLY EDUCATED, BUT SHE DESCRIBES HERSELF AS A DETECTIVE AND HAD THE WIT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE INSCRIPTION WAS SIGNIFICANT. I THINK I HAVE UNLOCKED ITS SECRET, BUT I WOULD BE PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. IN PARTICULAR, IS SHE RIGHT IN HER ASSUMPTION THAT THE LETTERS SIGNIFY SOMETHING TO WHICH WE SHOULD ATTEND? IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO ME THAT IT IS MERELY A CURIO. I HAVE MISSED OUR DISCUSSIONS, AND I FLATTER MYSELF THAT YOU ENJOYED THEM TOO. I HOPE THAT THIS CURIOUS BULLET MIGHT GIVE US THE EXCUSE THAT WE NEED TO REINSTATE THEM. PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS. YOURS AS ALWAYS, ADA COUNTESS OF LOVELACE

horsley towers east horsley surrey england my dear mrs lovelace i was unsure how to address you so i hope that this letter finds you and finds you well i am writing because i do not know who else to turn to and i figure that you might be able to help i am sorry for the trouble i may have caused by cyphering this letter but i was not sure that you would read a message sent in my hand not knowing nothing about me it seemed more likely you would make the effort if the message was harder to read if not and i am wrong about your interests in codes and cyphers then perhaps it wont matter whether you read it or not i am a detective in the small town of erin new york and in a recent investigation i came upon a strangeness that i cannot unpick i was asked to investigate a break in at a local warehouse the hasp had been removed and clumsily replaced alerting the owner but nothing seemed to be missing and the shipping crates remained sealed behind them i found a bullet carryng an unusual inscription and have included a sketch it is mighty unusual for a case to be marked in this way and the letters make no sense to me i am hoping that you will be able to help interpret them with luck that might shed some light on my investigation given the bullet was found with a shipment bound for england there may also be reason for you to be worried but i most sincerely hope not if you have read this far then please understand how much i appreciate your assistance i look forward with some eagerness to your reply with my gratitude miss kate warne

dear miss warne,
thank you for your letter and the intriguing puzzle that you sent me. i have discussed it with my close friend and collaborator mr charles babbage, and we are both of the opinion that it is a mystery that demands a little more context if we are to be of any assistance to you. we hope that we are able to help you, but we are somewhat uncertain whether this is something that demands our immediate attention. if so how do you propose that we should proceed? even with the improvements in transatlantic traffic it will take some time to investigate this matter by post and i am afraid we are still some way from the introduction of the transatlantic telegraph. (though our friend mr wheatstone is working all hours to hasten that development.) we would be grateful if you could reply with any further information that may help us.

on the matter of the bullet, mr babbage has suggested the possibility that the lettering might be of foreign origin, but we are not aware of a language in which this combination of latin consonants could signify an expressible word. he suggested also that the characters might be those of an acronym, though the lack of punctuation and the relatively large number of letters makes this, too, unlikely.

we are then brought to the possibility, which i am sure you had in mind, that the text on the case might represent some form of encyphered communication. the shortness of the text presents a significant problem. we are unable to apply our usual techniques of frequency analysis to determine any pattern, and without more context we have no cribs or other clues to its likely meaning. in your letter you mentioned that the bullet was found in a shipping warehouse near a stack of sealed crates, and that these were bound for england. we would find it most helpful if you could tell us, should you know, the contents of those crates, the individual or corporation to which they belong and the recipient for whom they are or were intended.

i am sorry it has taken so long for me to reply to you, but mr babbage is heavily involved in the preparations for the international fair to be held later in the year. given the prince consort’s involvement you can imagine that there are high expectations on all of those who are involved in its delivery. be assured however that we will give our full attention to your reply and we hope to be able to assist you.

with our very best wishes,
ada lovelace and charles babbage

my dear charles, i hope this letter finds you well rested, for i have the most surprising news. expecting a reply from miss warne i have been waiting eagerly for the post, in the hope that she would be able to shed more light on the mystery of the silver bullet. what i did not expect when the doorbell rang was that miss warne herself would be ushered into my morning room! she was somewhat dishevelled and close to starving, as if she had walked here, and it took some time for her to recover enough to tell me what she was doing in england. it appears that she took to heart our concern that this matter would be delayed by the continual exchange of letters, and, discovering that the shipping crates were to be transported to england on the pacific she made arrangements to travel with the cargo. what arrangements those might have been she has been too coy to explain. for the moment i have lodged her with my maid in the attic here at the towers. the staff have been marvellous, providing her with suitable clothes, and sharing meals. i am not sure how miss warne will manage in the longer term, but for now she is settled and i think we should concentrate our attention on the information that she has brought with her. given that there is a sensitivity to this matter, i would prefer to tell you about it in person. in any case, you may well wish to hear the story from miss warne herself, so i propose that we meet here at horsley at your earliest convenience. in a curious coincidence of timing sir charles is also planning to visit shortly to discuss installing his telegraphic system at our residences in order to speed communication. perhaps we can arrange matters so that he too can be briefed on the issues in this case. speaking of briefing, i think it would be appropriate to keep lord palmerston informed of our investigations. without saying too much at this stage, there are diplomatic issues at play, and he might prefer to lead on these matters. could i ask you to write to him? you know how he hates to be bothered by women. it might be a good idea to encipher all our communications with his office using our customary transposition cipher. i do not entirely trust the discretion of those in his private office. with my fondest regards, ada

### Challenge3B key: some spelling mistakes

my dear palmerston i believe that prince albert may already have written to you concerning this matter and i am a little embarrassed to write this letter at all but i hope you will understand i find myself at the mercy of two strong willed women who assure me that this matter is urgent you have already been informed about our unexpected guest miss warne who arrived last week to our astonishment on the steam ship pacific she is a little coy about how she afforded the journey and i suspect that she might have been a stowaway while i am inclined to deal strongly with that matter the countess has expressed the equally strong view that we should first address the reasons for miss warnes visit given the sensitivity of the matters described below i think she is probably right miss warne has determined that the mysterious bullet was manufactured by the imperial arms company which as you know is owned by julius kaiser sponsor of the india pavilion the bullet was designed as a novelty item to be distributed at the exhibition with the engraved letters denoting the date of the exhibition opening the date was encrypted the cypher in this case being a rather simple caesar shift i suppose kaiser felt that this was rather clever though it seems an obscure way to market his company that perhaps is a mark of the mans character he fancies himself the cleverest man in every room but he is funding the pavilion and it is important that we do nothing to offend him that discovery might have closed the matter and i was inclined to ship the somewhat overenthusiastic miss warne back to her home in new york however the countess has persuaded me that my initial impressions were prejudicial and there does seem to be something more to this affair miss warne found the bullet next to a stack of sealed crates marked with the logo of the manufacturer they had been shipped there from chicago the crates contained rifles and ammunition developed by the company for the climate in the subcontinent the company is hopeful that the british government and the eic would both be interested in purchasing them that does explain herr kaisers interest in the exhibition it will act as a market place for his new weapons butal so an opportunity to curry favour with the prince given his influence with the government that might improve his chance of winning a contract miss warnes wears that the crates had not been tampered with the company seals were intact witnessed by the photographs brought by miss warne and it is not clear how or why one of the bullets should have escaped them it seems possible that either a rival manufacturer or a criminal gang may have stolen the contents of one or more of the crates somehow managing to reseal them but leaving this one small clue to their activities in this we may have been lucky if the shipment had appeared to be deficient on arrival at the exhibition it would have been difficult to establish that the theft had occurred in the us we might then have been accused of carelessness in our handling of the consignment i think it would be in our best interests to examine the companys crates before they leave the ship which arrived in liverpool earlier this week fortunately the current dock workers strike has delayed unloading so we should have time to commission a full check of the cargo before it lands if anything is amiss then we will be able to assure mr kaiser that the issue arose before the crates reached us i am aware of the sensitivities in this matter with the display of the kohinoor at its heart the india pavilion is very dear to both the prince and her majesty the queen it would be most embarrassing if its principal sponsor herr kaisers hould feel that we are not affording him every assistance in his own endeavours with my very best wishes babbage
